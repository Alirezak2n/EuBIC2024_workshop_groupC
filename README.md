## Prediction models in proteomics, PROTrEIN workshop
This workshop is focused on the use of prediction models in proteomics. We will explore what tasks can be solved by machine learning, the history of these methods in proteomics and state-of-the-art models. In the afternoon session we will apply some of them in the hands-on exercises.
